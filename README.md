# Quantitative-Data-Analysis-Project-1

### An analysis of the relationship between the Raw NASA Task Load Index and the System Usability Scale

### Introduction

Welcome to the Quantitative Data Analysis Project repository. This project is an assignment paper completed for the Quantitative Data Analysis course at University College Dublin (UCD). The purpose of this project is to perform a quantitative data analysis, exploring the relationship between the Raw NASA Task Load Index (RTLX) and the System Usability Scale (SUS).

### Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the analysis of the association between subjective workload (RTLX) and system usability (SUS) in the context of voice user interfaces. The central objective is to ascertain whether a correlation exists between these two variables, shedding light on how perceived workload influences the usability of such interfaces.

### Data Analysis Steps

The project unfolds through a series of structured data analysis steps:

Data Preparation: The project's working directory is set, and the dataset "SusRtlx.csv" is loaded for analysis.
Data Cleaning: An initial data cleaning process identifies and addresses impossible scores and outliers, ensuring data accuracy and reliability.
Visualization: Boxplots and histograms are employed to visually explore the distribution of the data, providing insights into the potential presence of outliers and normality.
Descriptive Statistics: Key descriptive statistics for both RTLX and SUS scores are calculated, offering a comprehensive overview of the dataset.
Correlation Analysis: A scatterplot is generated to visually assess the relationship between SUS and RTLX scores. Statistical analysis, including Pearson correlation coefficient calculation, further investigates the strength of the relationship.
Regression Analysis: Linear regression analysis is conducted to establish a quantitative relationship between RTLX and SUS scores.

### Main Technologies Used

The project leverages the following main technologies:

R Programming Language: R is employed as the primary programming language for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.
RStudio: RStudio provides a user-friendly integrated development environment (IDE) for R, facilitating code execution, data exploration, and documentation.

### Conclusion

The Quantitative Data Analysis Project contributes valuable insights into the correlation between subjective workload (RTLX) and system usability (SUS) within the context of voice user interfaces. By analyzing and quantifying this relationship, the project enhances our understanding of usability factors and subjective workload perception.
